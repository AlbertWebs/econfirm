    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>

            We operate in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Kenya, including but not limited to financial service regulations, consumer protection laws, and the Data Protection Act, 2019. Our operations are structured to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Payment Compliance:</strong><br>
            All payments on the platform are processed exclusively through authorized mobile money services such as <strong>M-Pesa</strong>. We adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards where applicable, to prevent fraudulent and illicit transactions.

        <li>
            <strong>Audit and Record-Keeping:</strong><br>
            We maintain accurate records of all transactions, disputes, and communications for auditing, regulatory, and security purposes. These records are securely stored for a period not less than six (6) years and may be accessed in case of legal or compliance inquiries.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Cooperation with Authorities:</strong><br>
